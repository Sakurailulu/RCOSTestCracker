September 24, 2019
Achievement:
Reviewed previous demo video of current version of the application to help team members understand how the application is working 
Brainstormed to come up with new features we want to develop during this semester
Prioritized all the features we listed 
Downloaded and installed Android Studio and successfully created an emulator

Plan:
Come up with an idea to add all the courses from category automatically. (previously we manually added all the courses. Since the courses provided changed each semester, we want the application to update the course list by automatically extract from RPI )
Looking for an affordable android device so that group member can test the application on a real android device (basically emulator created by the android studio performed unstably)

Risk:
The main feature relies on clients to upload the backtest. If there is no client uploading any backtest, the main feature cannot be used.
